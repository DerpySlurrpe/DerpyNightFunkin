:dad:Ah, a new fair maiden has come in search of true love!
:dad:A serenade between gentlemen shall decide where her beautiful heart shall reside.
:bf:Huh? Where am I?
:bf:Tails was supposed to send me to that racing simulator so I could test my speed!
:bf:But now I'm in some sort of...Japanese dating game?...
:dad:Um...Ahem...
:dad:Mr. Needlemouse, I challenge you to a singing duel for the beautiful girl's heart!
:bf:A challenge, huh!
:bf:I suppose while I'm stuck here I might as well have some fun!
:bf:Bring it on, blondie!
:bf:(When I get back Tails is gonna have a LOT of explaining to do...)
